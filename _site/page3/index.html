    <p>As I have mentioned previously, I have begun reading <a href="http://amzn.to/PiXCiU">Statistical Methods in Bioinformatics by Ewens and Grant</a> and working selected problems for each chapter. In this post, I will give my solution to two problems. The first problem is pretty straightforward.</p>

    <p>As part of my effort to acquaint myself more with biology, bioinformatics, and statistical genetics, I am trying to find as many resources as I can that provide a solid foundation. For instance, I am wading through <a href="http://amzn.to/Mx5jCm">Molecular Biology of the Cell</a> at a pace of about 10-15 pages per day – this takes nearly an hour every day.</p>

    <p>It has been just a few weeks since <a href="http://ramhiserfamily.wordpress.com/">my wife, my son, and I</a> moved to Seattle so that I could begin my postdoc at <a href="http://www.fhcrc.org/en.html">The Hutch</a>. Now that we have been here a short time and are settled, we intend to start exploring Seattle, doing typical touristy things as well as non-touristy activities that only Seattlites would do. My wife purchased a detailed guide to Seattle that lists numerous activities, restaurants, scenery, etc. that would take months (years?) to complete. I prefer word of mouth though, so I asked some coworkers for recommendations. Here’s what they gave me:</p>

    <p>One of my <a href="http://ramhiser.com/blog/2012/01/09/goals-for-2012/">goals for 2012</a> has been to blog more. Much more. When I first set this goal, I had great aspirations of posting frequently. However, I
had a Ph.D. to complete, and quite frankly, it demanded much higher priority. Now that I have submitted my dissertation and completed my Ph.D. requirements, I have several half-finished posts that will
appear soon. Also, since I have made the switch to <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a>, I will be relocating selected posts from my previous Wordpress blog.</p>

    <p>I have never been one to set New Year’s resolutions. Personally, they instill a dangerous personal freedom that often yield naive, subconscious mentalities, such as I can do anything I want until December 31, and I will change abruptly the next day. However, my Ph.D. adviser has shown me the importance of setting goals in all things that I wish to accomplish as well as envisioning the finale to an arduous journey like a small child (read “John Ramey”) that pictures the waning warmth of fresh chocolate chip cookies smeared on his face. My adviser has always encouraged short-term and long-term goals but never required them. As I recently found out, my employer does. In addition, these goals are reviewed at the end of the fiscal year so that employees are realistic and held accountable.</p>
