    <p>One of my <a href="http://ramhiser.com/blog/2012/01/09/goals-for-2012/">goals for 2012</a> has been to blog more. Much more. When I first set this goal, I had great aspirations of posting frequently. However, I
had a Ph.D. to complete, and quite frankly, it demanded much higher priority. Now that I have submitted my dissertation and completed my Ph.D. requirements, I have several half-finished posts that will
appear soon. Also, since I have made the switch to <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a>, I will be relocating selected posts from my previous Wordpress blog.</p>

    <span class="post-date">09 Jan 2012</span>

    <p>I have never been one to set New Year’s resolutions. Personally, they instill a dangerous personal freedom that often yield naive, subconscious mentalities, such as I can do anything I want until December 31, and I will change abruptly the next day. However, my Ph.D. adviser has shown me the importance of setting goals in all things that I wish to accomplish as well as envisioning the finale to an arduous journey like a small child (read “John Ramey”) that pictures the waning warmth of fresh chocolate chip cookies smeared on his face. My adviser has always encouraged short-term and long-term goals but never required them. As I recently found out, my employer does. In addition, these goals are reviewed at the end of the fiscal year so that employees are realistic and held accountable.</p>

    <span class="post-date">07 Jan 2012</span>

    <p>Today was my 29th birthday, and I kept things simple: I ate with my wife and my newborn son at a local eatery. Later, my wife cooked steaks for dinner. For the most part, I took the day off in that I did not work on my dissertation. But I did spent much of the day tinkering with my <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a> installation – more about that later.</p>

        Steve Jobs' 2005 Stanford Commencement Address

    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">04 Dec 2011</span>

    <p>Given that there are almost 13 million views of Steve Jobs’ commencement address, I am certain that I missed this video when it went viral. I am glad that I did not see it until now because I may not have appreciated his words of wisdom. And although there are numerous quotes that I could list, I think my favorites are closely related to a few words of wisdom that my grandmother told me when I was younger.</p>

        Pseudo-Random vs. Random Numbers in R
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">25 Nov 2011</span>

    <p>Earlier, I found <a href="http://www.boallen.com/random-numbers.html">an interesting post from Bo Allen</a> on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudorandom_number_generator">pseudo-random</a> vs <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_number">random numbers</a>, where the author uses a simple bitmap (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_map">heat map</a>) to show that the <strong>rand</strong> function in <a href="http://www.php.net/">PHP</a> has a systematic pattern and compares these to <strong>truly random</strong> numbers obtained from <a href="http://www.random.org/">random.org</a>. The post’s results suggest that pseudo-randomness in <a href="http://www.php.net/">PHP</a> is faulty and, in general, should not be underestimated in practice. Of course, the findings should not be too surprising, as there is a large body of literature on the subtleties, philosophies, and implications of the <strong>pseudo</strong> aspect of the most common approaches to random number generation. However, it is silly that <a href="http://www.php.net/">PHP</a>’s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_number_generation">random number generator (RNG)</a> displays such an obvious pattern nowadays because there are several decent, well-studied pseudo-RNG algorithms available as well as numerous tests for randomness.  For a good introduction to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_number_generation">RNG</a>, I recommend <a href="http://www.johndcook.com/blog/2010/12/06/how-to-test-a-random-number-generator-2/">John D. Cook’s discussion on testing a random number generator</a>.</p>
